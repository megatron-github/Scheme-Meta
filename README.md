# Scheme_meta
An introduction to Scheme

We define our-lisp as a small subset of Scheme. The primitive data types are integers, symbols, pairs, and the empty list (). The primitive procedures are =, eq?, equal?, null?, the four arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/), car, cdr, cons, and format. Everything else is non-primitive, including environments and lambdas. This program is going to implement our-lisp in Scheme.
